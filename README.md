# Cyber_Security_Interview_Questions


Cyber Security Interview Questions is for students and working professionals who are preparing to get into , or switch to Cyber Security Job Roles . These questions are mostly crowd-sources , hence for many it may seem very trivial. I shall also add some questions that I faced in Cyber Security Interviews.

Different Cyber Security Job Roles - A look at different domains in Cyber Security, this is not perfect, but still can help to get some idea of different roles one might take in CYber Security Jobs

[Cyber Security Jobs Tweet*](https://twitter.com/abhinavkakku/status/1609385254615420929)
![Cyber Security Jobs](/Cyber_Security_Job_Roles.png)

The Tweet above or the MindMap of different possible Cyber Security Job Roles will help me escape the Question - " Why every question is not Offensive or Defensive only, I only want Pentesting Questions, or only SOC Analyst Questions." 
Answer - " Cyber Security is big domain and needs for different roles are different. "

Note-1: We will keep updating this page (Last updated : 21 July, 2k23), just started so don't expect this to become encyclopedia yet

Note-2: Some questions can fall under more than one Category, forgive me for that, I will try not to repeat. Yet some questions that have very broad scope of followup questions maybe repeated ( as it gives context).

--------------------

## Basic Cyber Security Questions

Some basic questions that are very fundamental in nature, are directly or sometimes in-directly related to Cyber Security.
These help establish some baseline, and everytime when one of these questions are asked, try to align the answer to Cyber Security.
Also, when answering these, try not to miss the basic points, often the interviewer might want to hear some particular keyword, so dont rush on hearing a easy question, gather yourself and the answer and answer it.

----

## Opinion based questions or Scenario....

These questions are to know your views, and there is usually no right or wrong answer here. It is more of a discussion to know your opinions , the way you see the problem or solve it, there is/are always more approaches to solve the problem.

2. Geo-Blocking IP ranges is a good Idea ? Why or Why not ?
