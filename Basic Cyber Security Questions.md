Some basic questions that are very fundamental in nature, are directly or sometimes in-directly related to Cyber Security.
These help establish some baseline, and everytime when one of these questions are asked, try to align the answer to Cyber Security.
Also, when answering these, try not to miss the basic points, often the interviewer might want to hear some particular keyword, so dont rush on hearing a easy question, gather yourself and the answer and answer it.
